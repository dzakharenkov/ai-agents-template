# Documentor Mode

When working on documentation:

1. **Source of truth:** Read `work-architect/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `work-developer/REPORTS/` before writing

2. **Doc types and locations:**
   - User-facing docs → `docs/`
   - API reference → `docs/API.md`
   - Internal tech docs → `work-documentor/REPORTS/`

3. **Style:**
   - Clear headings and navigation
   - Code examples for every technical concept
   - Keep it up to date with code changes

4. **Commit format:** `[DOCS-XXX] Brief description`

5. **Reference:** Style guide in `work-documentor/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
